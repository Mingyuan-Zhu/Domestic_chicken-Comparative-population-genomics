### Abstract

As human production patterns have changed from hunting to settlement, more than 40 species have been domesticated over the course of thousands of years, and they have gained more phenotypic diversity than their ancestors during domestication. Among them, chicken, as the most diverse representative of birds, has a large differentiation in feather color, individual size, and vision. Traditional genetic studies often use QTL mapping, which is cumbersome and has a high false positive rate. The location of the location is often large and cannot be accurately located. However, with the maturity and popularity of second-generation sequencing technology, the cost of sequencing has been reduced by nearly a hundred times. Therefore, population genomics, a method of genetic inference from the entire population genome, has developed rapidly. Based on the theory of population genomics, population genetics is based on sequencing technology and genomic maps, using statistical and mathematical principles to study whole genomes on a population scale, exploring site-specific effects and migration of gene frequencies and genotype frequencies. And the genome-wide effects of genetic drift and other genetic structures, explore the selection effects and mutations behind it. On the basis of resequencing, many of the diversity of chickens have been explained, such as the plateau mechanism of Tibetan chickens and the size and size of the body, clearly explaining the genetic basis of chicken domestication.

Yuanbao Chicken is a famous ornamental chicken. It has the appearance of Jin Yuanbao and has been cultivated since the Tang Dynasty. Yuanbao chicken is an excellent biological model, especially phenotypes such as very small size and solid color feathers are widely used in research. To better understand the mutations that affect the color change of livestock feathers, we used the comparative population genomics based on NGS data to study the genome of Yuanbaoji. We will identify a range of genetic mutations and regions that may affect feather color, providing new insights into pigmentation patterns in chickens.
